# Open University Course Submissions Repository

Welcome to the repository documenting my journey through the Open University program provided by the University of Helsinki! This repository showcases my work over the past few months, where I engaged with over 50 reading materials and completed more than 140 exercises. The course, organized into seven distinct parts, focused on mastering single-page applications using React and complementing them with RESTful web services built on Node.js.

## Course Highlights

Throughout the course, organized into seven parts, I delved into various topics to build a solid foundation in web development:

- **Debugging Applications:** Explored techniques and best practices for debugging React applications.

- **Configuration and Runtime Environment Management:** Learned how to configure and manage the runtime environment effectively.

- **User Administration:** Gained insights into user administration within the context of single-page applications.

- **Testing Practices:** Covered unit and integration testing using Jest to ensure the reliability of the developed applications.

- **End-to-End Testing with Cypress:** Explored end-to-end testing practices using Cypress to validate the functionality from a user perspective.

- **Advanced State Management:** Mastered advanced state management using Redux, useQuery, and Context API for building scalable and efficient applications.
